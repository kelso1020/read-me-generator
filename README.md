## Description
I created this application as a tool for anyone who needs to create a basic README.md file. 

## Installation
If you'd like to use this application to create your own README file:

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/kelso1020/read-me-generator.git
```
2. Install NPM packages
```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

This README Generator was designed to create a basic outline for a README file. When
```sh
node index.js
```
is run in the terminal, the user will be given several prompts to submit information including the title and description for the user's project file. The user will submit any installation instructions and usage information about their project when prompted, as well as any contribution guidelines or test instructions the user would like to include. The user will also be prompted to include their GitHub username and email address so anyone who views their finished README file knows where to get ahold of them if necessary. The last prompt is to pick a project license from a predetermined list. When a license is selected, it will be listed in the README file as well as display as a badge at the top of the file.
